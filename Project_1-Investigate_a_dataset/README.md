## Project Overview

In this project, I will be analyzing a dataset no_show_appointments.csv from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments) and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

### Learning Objectives
+ Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
+ Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
+ Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
+ Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
+ Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
+ Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
+ Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
